# mips_L_multi
This is a modified version of the Multicycle MIPS processor design from Digital Design and Computer Architecture" (2nd ed.) by David M. Harris and Sarah L. Harris (Morgan-Kaufmann, 2013).

In this version each module has been separated into its own file and a package has been added that specifies MIPS opcodes and function codes using enum types. Adding enums allows the opcode and function code to be displayed in simulation in symbolic form.
