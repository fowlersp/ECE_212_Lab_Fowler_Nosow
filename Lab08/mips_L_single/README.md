# mips_L_single_dev
This is a modified version of the Single-Cycle MIPS processor design from <em>Digital Design and Computer Architecture" (2nd ed.)</em> by David M. Harris and Sarah L. Harris (Morgan-Kaufmann, 2013).

In this version each module has been separated into its own file and a package has been added that specifies MIPS opcodes and function codes using enum types.
Adding enums allows the opcode and function code to be displayed in simulation in symbolic form.
