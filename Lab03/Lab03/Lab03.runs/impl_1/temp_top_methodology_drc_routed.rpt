2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell nolabel_line72/U_COUNT3C/segs_n_reg[5]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) nolabel_line72/U_SSN/segs_n_reg[0]/PRE,
nolabel_line72/U_SSN/segs_n_reg[1]/PRE,
nolabel_line72/U_SSN/segs_n_reg[2]/PRE,
nolabel_line72/U_SSN/segs_n_reg[3]/PRE,
nolabel_line72/U_SSN/segs_n_reg[4]/PRE
nolabel_line72/U_SSN/segs_n_reg[5]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell nolabel_line72/U_COUNT3C/segs_n_reg[6]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) nolabel_line72/U_SSN/segs_n_reg[6]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell nolabel_line72/U_COUNT3C/segs_n_reg[6]_i_4, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) nolabel_line72/U_SSN/segs_n_reg[6]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
